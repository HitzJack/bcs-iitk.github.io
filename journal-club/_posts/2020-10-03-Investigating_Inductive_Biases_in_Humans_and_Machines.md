**Title:** Investigating Inductive Biases in Humans and Machines
<!--**Type:** Own PhD Research --><br>
**Abstract:** 
<br>Meta-learning describes how an intelligent agent leverages prior learning episodes as a basis for quickly improving performance on a novel task. Bayesian hierarchical modeling provides a theoretical framework for formalizing this capability as statistical inference for a set of parameters that are shared as an initialization for domain-specific learners. She will demonstrate how to reformulate recent algorithms for meta-learning as methods for statistical inference in a hierarchical Bayesian model, thus bridging these two independent approaches. This connection provides a means to understand and improve on the computational underpinnings of algorithms for meta-learning in machine learning, as well as to adapt cognitive models expressed in the language of hierarchical modeling to the modern machine learning toolbox and to naturalistic stimuli.<br>
