title: InfoTabS - Inference on Tables as Semi-Structured Data

abstract: Understanding ubiquitous semi-structured tabulated data requires not only comprehending the meaning of text fragments, but also implicit relationships between them. We argue that such data can prove as a testing ground for understanding how we reason about information.

**Abstract:** 
<br>Understanding ubiquitous semi-structured tabulated data requires not only comprehending the meaning of text fragments, but also implicit relationships between them. We argue that such data can prove as a testing ground for understanding how we reason about information. To study this, we introduce a new dataset called INFOTABS, consisting of human-written textual hypotheses based on premises that are tables extracted from Wikipedia info-boxes. Our analysis shows that the semi-structured, multi-domain and heterogeneous nature of the premises admits complex, multi-faceted reasoning.

He has also shared many of his experiences and some valuable insights for heading into research as a career option.<br>
