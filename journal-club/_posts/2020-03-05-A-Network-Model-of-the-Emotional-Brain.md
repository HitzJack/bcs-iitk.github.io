**Abstract:** Where does emotion reside in the brain? The key question addressed here is as follows: how is emotion instantiated in the brain? Thinking about the brain basis of emotion has fluctuated between a focus on regions and a focus on circuits. In the 1920s and 1930s, work by Cannon and Bard propelled the hypothalamus to the epicenter of the emotional brain  At the same time, the idea that emotion depends on distributed circuits also was present in early work. Today, characterizing circuit interactions is believed to be key to unraveling how emotion is organized in the brain. Overall, this review clarifies why the impact of emotion is wide-ranging, and how emotion is interlocked with perception, cognition, motivation, and action.
