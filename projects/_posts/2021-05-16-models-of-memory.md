title: Models of Memory


abstract: Human memory can store large amounts of information. Nevertheless, recalling is often a challenging task. In this project we look at the past models of memory retrieval namely the hopfield network and the mean field theory. After the classical models, we also develop a more realistic sequential neural network model for recall tasks(For eg, NTM, MANN etc). After that, we will try to optimize and develop our own models of memory that may be

Deliverables  
Mid-term: Basic Literature review and implementing hopfield network. Machine Learning basics  
End-term: Neural network models of memory.
