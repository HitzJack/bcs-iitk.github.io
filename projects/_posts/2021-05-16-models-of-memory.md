title: Models of Memory
abstract: Human memory can store large amounts of information. Nevertheless, recalling is often a challenging task. In this project we look at the past models of memory retrieval namely the hopfield network and the mean field theory. After the classical models, we also develop a more realistic sequential neural network model for recall tasks(For eg, NTM, MANN etc). After that, we will try to optimize and develop our own models of memory that may be
