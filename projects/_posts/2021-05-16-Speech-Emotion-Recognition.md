title: Speech Emotion Recognition
abstract: Using RAVDESS dataset which contains  around 1500 audio file inputs from 24 different actors (12 male and 12 female ) who recorded short audios in 8 different emotions, we will train a NLP- based model which will be able to detect among the 8 basic emotions as well as the gender of the speaker i.e. Male voice or Female voice.  After training we can deploy this model for predicting with live voices.
