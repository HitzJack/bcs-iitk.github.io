title: Mapping of Brain Signals
abstract: To understand the working, function and to some extent, the structure of the brain specifically so, by using empathy for pain to target Bilateral Anterior Insula and Anterior Cingulate Cortex using external stimuli.To study Brain activity and function using EEG data, learn how to analyse this data and explore the reason behind certain behaviour as we know it.

The project aims to fulfill its objective through a research study:<br>
"*To find the effect of acetaminophen in empathy and social decision-making.*"

The goals hence, can be outlined as:
* Understand the concept of empathy for pain and in this pursuit monitor and understand brain functionality to a certain aspect.
* Learn EEG data processing and analysis using the EEGLAB toolbox of MATLAB.
* Generalise and work towards automating the process of filtering EEG data.
* Study, record, process, observe, analyse, discuss and present results obtained from the research study by implementing everything learnt to organic data.
* Compile results and derive a comprehensible conclusion.
