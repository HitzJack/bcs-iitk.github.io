title: Knowledge Graph Reasoning for Explainable Recommendation
abstract: Knowledge Graphs connect various types of information related to items into a unified space. Different paths connecting entity pairs often carry relations of different semantics, and PGPR  (Policy Guided Path Reasoning) models these with the help of high-quality user and item representations generated using the TransE graph embedding scheme.

Knowledge Graphs connect various types of information related to items into a unified space. Different paths connecting entity pairs often carry relations of different semantics, and PGPR  (Policy Guided Path Reasoning) models these with the help of high-quality user and item representations generated using the TransE graph embedding scheme.<br>
This project - 
* highlights the importance of KGs to define and interpret the process of recommendation.
* proposes an RL-based approach (with soft rewards, a multi-hop scoring function, and action pruning)
* imposes a beam search algorithm to sample diverse reasoning paths and items for recommendation.
* evaluates this method on four Amazon datasets to get explicit reasoning behind the predicted paths.
