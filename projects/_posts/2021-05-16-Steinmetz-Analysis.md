title: Analysing Steinmetz dataset to find the role of Hippocampus in Decision Making.
abstract: The motive of the project is to learn how to analyse a NeuroImaging data. We start from the basics, learn about brain anatomy and various neuroimaging dataset and various techniques/libraries helpful in analysing data. Then everything learnt to analyse Steinmetz dataset to find the role of a particular brain group [this depends on the student’s interest, for now I have chosen Hippocampus which is involved with memory and learning] in the decision making process. So the aim would be basically to understand the role of memory and learning [at which stage are they required] in a decision making process.

Deliverables  
Mid-term Deliverables: Learn all the basic ideas, brain anatomy, techniques and libraries like numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib. Literature Review and then build a hypothesis [what can be the role of “the brain group”?].  
End-term Deliverables: Prove the hypothesis.
