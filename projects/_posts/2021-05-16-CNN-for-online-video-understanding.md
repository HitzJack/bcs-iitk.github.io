title: Convolutional Network for Online Video Understanding
abstract: Using UCF101 and Something-Something datasets, we implement high-quality action classification and video captioning within a video, where each video can consist of a few hundred frames. We will look at previous approaches and implement a convolutional network for online video understanding. The network architecture takes long-term content into account and enables fast per-video processing at the same time.
