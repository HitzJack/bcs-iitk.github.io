title: How can I explain this to you?
abstract: The motive of the project is to address the major concerns of the deep learning models. The dl models are black boxes needed to be explained. For this part we will learn how we can get insights from the model, about the model. In the second part, we will address another major concern about dl models- Robustness/Vulnerabilities. How the dl models can fooled and how we can overcome these vulnerabilities by defense techniques
