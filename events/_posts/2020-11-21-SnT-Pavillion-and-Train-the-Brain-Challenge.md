## Hello Y20! 
We bring to you an exciting and fun-learning opportunity "Train the Brain"! 
To participate, give an interesting yet suitable name to the projects we showed you in the orientation([Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BgtRDrRjYrPZSTxjAcF13Ofnol6x9mZqhSSL1c9vG6c/edit?usp=sharing)). Mind you, you don't have to be a neuroscience-pro to give names to them- suggest names based on whatever you understand from them: this activity is meant to give you a good introductory exposure to cognitve science and what the club deals with! Submit your responses below.

You can check those projects again on our website!
